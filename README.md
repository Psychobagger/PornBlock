# Background
I sought to block porn sites on my computer, and share it with family and friends. I worked on this project on my own before finding the Block List project; so I incorporated my porn list into their block list.

I found the site tblop.com initially. I searched for similar sites and was intrigued when I found several dozen sites with the exact same HTML layout as tblop (down to class names and indentation structure). Tblop is run by someone named Greg, and it is probable that every other site I found and scraped for links is run by Greg, or someone affiliated with him, as well.
